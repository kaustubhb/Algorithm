Q. *Filtering*. Which of the following require saving all the values from standard
input (in an array, say), and which could be implemented as a filter using only
a fixed number of variables and arrays of fixed size (not dependent on N)? For 
each, the input comes from standard input and consists of N real numbers between
0 and 1.

1. Print the maximum and minimum numbers - Yes, can be a filter
2. Print the median of the numbers - No
3. Print the k<sup>th</sup> smallest value, for k less than 100 - Yes, Can be 
implemented by storing k smallest values in a max-heap
4. Print the sum of the squares of the numbers - Yes, only a running sum needs 
to be maintained.
5. Print the average of the N numbers - Yes, need only running sum and number of
elements.
6. Print the percentage of numbers greater than the average - No
7. Print the N numbers in increasing order - No
8. Print the N numbers in random order - No
