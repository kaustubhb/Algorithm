Q. *Sorting three numbers*. Suppose that the variables a, b, c, and t are all the
same numeric primitive type. Show that the following code puts a, b, and c in
ascending order:

```
if (a > b) { t = a; a = b; b = t; }
if (a > c) { t = a; a = c; c = t; }
if (b > c) { t = b; b = c; c = t; }
```

A. First statement swaps a and b if a > b. Now, a <= b after 1st statement.\
2nd statement swaps a and c if a > c. After these 2 statements, a is smallest.\
3rd statement swaps b and c if b is larger than c. Hence b <= c after 3rd statement.\
So, `a <= b <= c` after these 3 statements.
