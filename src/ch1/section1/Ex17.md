Q. Criticize the following recursive function:

```
public static String exR2(int n)
{
    String s = exR2(n-3) + n + exR2(n-2) + n;
    if (n <= 0) return "";
    return s;
}
```

A. Since if condition is below recursive call, the base case will never be
reached, this program will stack overflow due to infinite recursion.
