Q. Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (queue) enqueue and
dequeue operations. The enqueue operations put the integers 0 through 9 in 
order onto the queue; the dequeue operations print out the return value. Which 
of the following sequence(s) could not occur?
1. `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`
2. `4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1`
3. `2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0`
4. `4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9`

A. Numbers can only occur in sequence, so only (1) can occur.
