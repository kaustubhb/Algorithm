/* Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity,
 * N people are in dire straits and agree to the following strategy to
 * reduce the population. They arrange themselves in a circle (at positions
 * numbered from 0 to Nâ€“1) and proceed around the circle, eliminating every
 * Mth person until only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus
 * figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated. Write a Queue client
 * Josephus that takes N and M from the command line and prints out the order
 * in which people are eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to
 * sit in the circle)
