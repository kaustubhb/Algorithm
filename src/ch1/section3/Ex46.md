Q. *Forbidden triple for stack generability*. Prove that a permutation can be 
generated  by a stack (as in the previous question) if and only if it has no 
forbidden triple (a, b, c) such that a < b < c with c first, a second, and b 
third (possibly with other intervening integers between c and a and 
between a and b).

A. Let's assume the permutation generated by a valid stack has 3 numbers
which occur in sequence c, a, and b, where (a < b < c) \
=> c has been popped \
=> all elements upto c, including a and b have been pushed to stack. \
Since a is popped after c, \
=> any elements pushed after a have already been popped \
=> since b > a, b has already been popped \
But b is popped after a according to assumption above \
Thus, the assumption is false, and c -> a -> b cannot be generated with
given conditions.
